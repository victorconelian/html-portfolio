<h1>The Best Animes according to me (Victor)</h1>

<h2>My top 3 animes of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Shokugeki (Food War)</h3>
<p>Problably my favourite.<br/>
It's a complete one. <br/>
First it's about cooking, something that takes my attention.<br/>
We have competition (food war), character development, a litte bit of romance and a lot of humor.</p>

<h3>Chainsaw man</h3>
<p>I pretty like the main character Denji because of his personality and history. <br/>
That guy is the funniest one being himself.<br/>
A lot of fights and <br/>
WE HAVE MAKIMA AS WELL</p>

<h3>Horimiya</h3>
<p>Comfort anime for times that I feel a litte down.</p>
